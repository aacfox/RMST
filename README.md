C++ Implementation of [a randomized expected linear time MST algorithm by D. Karger et al(1995)](./README.md#randomized-om-mst-algo).  
>[!CAUTION]
>Time complexity is currently semilinear because I'm struggling with the last of the subroutines of the algorithm.

## Introduction 
For I am Constantine, the 'C' ~~in C++~~ in my nickname! And this is my half-assed but whole-hearted attempt to understand and implement the mentioned algo. I can hardly explain why of all the probable topics I deem this the most exciting, so here we go.  
In the wild, there exist other deadly cool algos for the same purpose (which is finding MSTs[^1] of graphs, in case you forgot) but this one just rubs me the right way and was easier to comprehend and finally implement. [Others](./README.md#other-cool-mst-algos) are deterministic with time complexities being great always without degenerating in worst cases.  
[^1]: [Minimum spanning tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_spanning_tree) (or minimum spanning forest - which is a more general notion).  

## What it does
Eats graph, poos its MSF[^1] in the same format!  

### Limitations so far  
[The program](./mst_generator.exe) supports only input files with `.csv` extension and formatted as ***edge list*** with ***semicolon*** as a delimiter and ***integral*** weights. See [example](./docs/wikipedia_graph.csv). To fulfill more complicated tasks source code provides more powerful tools not included in the executable ~~'cause of my lazy ass~~ to keep things simple and focus resources of humankind on [much bigger problem](./docs/CONTRIBUTING.md#tasks).  

## Get started
The simplest case:
1. Place [program](./mst_generator.exe) AND your input files in the same folder or COPY a path to the desired location to the clipboard  
2. Run program.
   * If you chose the first option, proceed to step 3.
   * Otherwise press `1`, `Enter`, paste the path from the clipboard, `Enter`.  
     If the message "Success!" popped, press `3`, then `Enter`.
3. If you want to proccess all found files at once:
  * press `2`, `Enter`.
  * proceed to step 4.
4. Otherwise to process one by one:
  * press `0`, `Enter`. A list of found files should show up.
  * enter the index of the desired file, press `Enter`
5. Enjoy the results! For a proper and safe exit from the program enter `-1`.  
   p.s. just kidding, you may as well just throw your device out of the window

***For any more advanced techniques, we'll have to dive into the source code. So first of all, let's clone the repository and build the project.***  
>[!WARNING]
>* My imple uses features of `C++23`, already supported by `MSVC`. There's no and will never be any endeavour to make up for that with `macros` or whatnot from my side. So if you want to run my code on older versions of compilers, that is entirely on your own. My sincere apologies...  
>* All source code files are provided with a `.cpp` extension while containing module interface code, so make sure the compiler interprets them as one.

### The algorithm's source code
The actual implementation of the algorithm is in a [separate file](./graph.cpp), designated as a member function template `mst()` of a class template named `Graph`, parameterized by the maximum theoretically possible `number of vertices` in a given graph for a given application, and by `type` representing weights of edges, respectively. 
 
Any given graph is stored in a data member as a plain `vector<Graph::Edge>` representing an edge list. But `mst()` is oblivious of this fact, so feel free to change the storage until a type-complete instance of `Graph` constitutes the `std::ranges::range` concept, and the derefencing of iterators returns `Graph::Edge`.  

`Graph` also has several `named constructors`. Specifically:
* `Graph::from_grid` — creates a graph from any 2D-range (i.e. supporting two consecutive subscript `operator[]`)
* `Graph::from_csv` — creates a graph from any `std::istream` formatted as explained above

Check [source code](./graph.cpp) for the full signature and documentation.  

### Dependencies
***The imple is self-contained. No third-party library is required.***  
As per below is just a description of the internal relations.
* [boilerplate.cpp](./boilerplate.cpp) is self-explanatory. Contains a bunch of utils, and in the common case should not pique any of your interest, as I tried to name those utils properly. If any confusion arises, check it to understand, what one or the other does. This module imported in every other file.
* [main.cpp](./main.cpp) — driver code; look at how mst_generator.exe is built from the inside. Depends on the other both.
